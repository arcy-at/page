    <h1>I Am a Commenting NINJA</h1>
    <p>This paragraph is perfect. I want everyone to see it.</p>
    <!-- <p>This paragraph has some content that I’m not sure about yet. I better hide it with a comment until I do some more research. I'm going to go ahead and make sure it's ready by placing the correct tags around the whole paragraph.</p> -->
    <h2>This is a super spiffy heading about using comments.</h2>
    <!-- <h2>This heading is MUCH better than the one above, but it just isn’t ready to publish yet. I'm going to go ahead and make sure it's ready by placing the correct tags around the whole heading.</h2> -->
    <p>This may be the best paragraph ever written.</p>
    <!-- <p>This paragraph used to be the best paragraph ever written. I mean, it is really, really good. It is so good, I don’t want to delete it. I may decide it is actually better than the best paragraph ever written. I'm going to go ahead and make sure it's ready by placing the correct tags around the whole paragraph.</p> -->
    <h2>The Purpose of Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments have two basic purposes. Let me talk about them in the next paragraph.</p>
    <p>When we code, we need to leave descriptions of things as we move along to help us remember what things are for.
        We also need to leave them for those that come along behind us. Without comments, it can increase the amount of
        time to debug exponentially. </p>
    <!-- It is pretty cool that Mr. Lovett provides me awesome opportunities to make really great grades in his class. Unfortunately, Mr. Lovett is going to start taking off 5 points for mistakes with structure and headings. That means, you should BE CAREFUL!! In fact, don’t even tell him I told you, hide this paragraph in a comment. He’ll NEVER even see it!!    -->
