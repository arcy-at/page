        The purpose of this document is to set forth the policies governing the use of all District
        technology resources by students while on or near school property, in school vehicles and at

        Please read the following Acceptable Use Policy carefully before signing your registration

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>NEISD is pleased to offer students access to District computers and other hardware, the
        use of communications systems1, the Internet and a wide array of other technology and
        online resources to promote educational excellence during in-person and/or virtual
        instruction and learning. Technology can expand a studentâ€™s access to educational
        materials, prepare students by providing workforce skills and college readiness, and lead
        to personal growth. The District recognizes, however, that access to technology must be
        given with clear guidelines, expectations, and supervision to protect students. This policy
        is designed to make parents/guardians, teachers and administrators partners to teach
        students how to be responsible users of technology.</p>

    <p>The school district will educate all students about appropriate online behavior, including
        interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms and
        cyberbullying awareness and response.</p>

    <p>The District will hold ALL students responsible for their use of technology, whether District provided or
        personal, and they are expected to act in an appropriate manner in accordance
        with campus procedures, District policy and procedures, and legal requirements. This
        applies to the use of all District technology resources by students while on or near school
        property, in school vehicles and at school-sponsored activities on- or off-campus, as well
        as the use of all District technology resources via off-campus remote access.</p>
