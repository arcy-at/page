            <h1 class='display-3' id="main">What is clean code?</h1>

            <p>Clean code is a reader-focused development style that produces software that's easy to
                write, read and
                maintain. Developers are often tempted to consider their work complete when the application operates as
                expected. But we're not merely writing code for computer consumption. We're also writing for humans as
                well.

        <div class='text-section'>
            <h2 class="display-4">1. You're an author</h2>
            <p class="text-center">An Author is someone who writes <b>as a profession</b>. Technically, coding /
                programming <b>is</b> writing</p>
        </div>
        <div class='text-section'>
            <h2 class="display-4">2. It's foundational</h2>
            <p>Clean Code pays off. <b>Especially</b> when it's being tested or being <i>refactored</i> clean code leads
                to software that is highly modular. </p>
        </div>
        <div class='text-section'>
            <h2 class="display-4">3. Justify your technique</h2>
            <p>Clean code doesn't happen on accident, it requires actual focus on what you're creating. Saying that
                clean code is using comments, and thats it, then you don't know what it is.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='text-section'>
            <h2 class="display-4">4. Reading is hard</h2>
            <p>Writing code is kinda easy. <b>Reading it is hard.</b> If you are unable to read the code you just wrote,
                how in the <i>world</i> are you going to let other people understand it, or even yourself after a bit?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='text-section'>
            <h2 class="display-4">5. Technical debt is depressing</h2>
            <p>Writing bad code gives you <i>technical debt</i>. In some cases, it <i>can</i> be good. But when you get
                a lot of it, it will drive the talent away. When the easiest things actually take effort to do, people
                start to leave.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='text-section'>
            <h2 class="display-4">6. You're Lazy</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes, lazy can be bad. But thats the <mark>wrong kind of lazy.</mark> The good kind of lazy, the
                efficient kind, is applied when doing clean code. When you put extra care into the code so it doesn't
                become a <i>mess</i>. Being sloppy is never a good thing. It slows you down, <b>By a lot.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='text-section'>
            <h2 class="display-4">7. Don't be a verb</h2>
            <p>Like seriously, don't. It's embarrassing. Hearing "yeah this code has been {name}d takes you feel both
                unconfortable and embarrassed.</p>
