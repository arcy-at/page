        <h1>Images as Block and Inline Elements</h1>

        <h2>What is the difference between a block and inline elements?</h2>

        <p>
            Most HTML elements are block elements. For example, the paragraph tag is a block element. They start on a
            new line
            and span the width of the document. Heading tags are also block elements. Good examples of inline elements
            are the italics and emphasis tags and the bold or strong tags. These elements do not start on a new line and
            only take up as much width as necessary. There is a list of block and inline elements on <a
                title='HTML Block and inline Elements' target='_blank'
                href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp'>this</a>
            website.

        <h2>Images as Block Elements</h2>
        <img src='./images/datalogo.png' width="800px">
        <p> The above image is a block element. Notice that it is up against the left margin and this paragraph is also
            up
            against the left margin? By the way, if you set the image width to 800px it will appear correctly on your
            page.</p>

        <h2>Images as Inline Elements</h2>

        <p>
            <!-- <span><img src='./images/+1.png'></span> -->
            <!-- MOVED BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO AAAAAAAAAA -->
            We can do some really spiffy stuff using images inline. For example, we can have images wrap nicely around
            an image that pertains to the content/text our audience is reading.
            When doing this, it's important to place the image in the right place within the content.
            Notice how the image at the beginning of the paragraph doesn't look right? Place the image at the bottom of
            this paragraph.
            Does that fix our problem? Why not? <mark>In the space below, use those critical thinking skills
                to tell me why the image appears the way it does within the text as an
                inline
                element.</mark> You will be happy to know that when we get to CSS, we can make this look
            <b><i>MUCH</i></b> better!
