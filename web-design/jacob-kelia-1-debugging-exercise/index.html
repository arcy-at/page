        <h2>With a Debugging Exercise</h2>
        <img src="images/healthy.png" alt="exercise" width="100px">
        <p>This debugging exercise is really more of an expression of gratitude for my students. I never really
            get a chance to tell my students how much I appreciate them and <b>especially</b> the work they do
            for me in my classes. While my projects are typically pretty easy, they can get challenging at
            times. Furthermore, we are in a pandemic and everything seems to be more difficult even the easy
            things.</p>

        <h2>Video Feeds On</h2>
        <img src="images/video-conference.jpg" alt="video conference image" width="200px">
        <p>Let me start off
            by saying thank you to those of you who feel comfortable sharing your video feed with me. I
            know for some of you this is uncomfortable and I get it. I also know there are those that
            are hiding the fact that they are playing video games; but honestly with you guys, that’s a
            very small number. To those of you who do continually keep your video feed on, I just want
            you to know that you make my day so much better. To just see you is such an encouragement to
            me. Moreover, when I get a smile from my corny jokes and see your reactions it really makes
            my day. Thank you for being vulnerable with me in this new way of learning/teaching.</p>

        <h2>Always On Time</h2>
        <img src="images/time-is-money.jpg" alt="funny guy and clock" width="300px">

        <p>
            <b>Next I want to thank you for always showing up on time and sticking with me until I
                dismiss you. I know this is the expectation. BUT, You guys do it...<b>EVERY...DAY!!</b>
                In fact, you guys are usually waiting on me to open the zoom. That truly is a blessing
                for me. Thank you!
            </b>
        </p>

        <h2>Rock STARS!!</h2>
        <img src="images/guitarist.jpg" alt="guitar hero" width="600px">

        <p>Next, I want to talk about your coding. You guys have come so far!! In fact, there is
            only one more thing I wanted to talk to you about as far as HTML goes before we move
            on to CSS. That last thing is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp"
                target="_blank">tables.</a> I think I will wait until we get into CSS before we
            do that one. The reason is we really need to figure out how to debug our code. This
            is a skill <b>every</b> programmer uses on a daily basis. Before we get into CSS, I
            would be failing you if I didn’t give you a few debugging exercises to help
            you find your rhythm.
        </p>

        <h2>Iframes!!! </h2>

        <p>Now that I think about it, there is one other thing I wanted to show you. This one is
            SOOOOO cool. It is called an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp" target="_blank"
                iframe></a>. Basically, an Iframe lets you put a web page within a web
            page. Have
            you seen web pages with youtube videos embedded into them? Iframes are how they
            do it.</p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tn9S9WNXG5E" frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <mark>
            <p>I’m not going to make your life very difficult debugging that Iframe. But what I
                want you to do is add an Iframe under it to a YouTube video you like. If it’s
                short I might even have time to watch it.</p>

        <p>Look at me! My thank you has turned into coding. While I did intend for that to
            happen, I also wanted this to be a fun adventure. </p>

        <h2>Let’s Wrap this up!</h2>
        <img src="images/checkmark.png" alt="check mark" width="100px">

        <p>In conclusion, I just want to say thank you. You really do mean the world to me and I
            am very excited about the cool things we are going to do next semester. Let’s look
            at the reasons I’m so thankful for you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Video feeds on</li>
            <li>You are on time</il>
            <li>Coding rock stars</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Thank you,</p>
